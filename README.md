# pokemon

This is a FrontEnd App project Giving to me by my mentor(Mr Peter Agent)

The task is to implement a simple pokemon api consumer using the publicly available API

# Routes

/login
protected Routes:

# /home - contains a table of icon, name and pokeball of 151 pokemon,

    --clicking on pokemon icon or name will redirect you to a details page
    --clicking on pokeball if conditions for capture either night or day is met will display a modal with a slide bar.
      that allows you to catch the pokemone

# /pokemone/details/{id} - displays the evolution, type, icon on a card

## /pokemon/caught which displays pokemon's caught by user

# Tech used in building project

App was built using React typeScript (vite)

# App setup

$ cd frontend

# Disclaimer
